The previous solution works great for only one component, but imagine having to
do this for every component you want custom styles for. That could get a bit
tedious to manage. Thankfully, there's a better way to do this. React Native
Elements ships with a 3 utilities for large-scale theming.

Firstly you'll want to set up your `ThemeProvider`.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider, Button, createTheme } from '@rneui/themed';

const theme = createTheme({
  Button: {
    raised: true,
  },
});

// Your App
const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Button title="My Button" />
      <Button title="My 2nd Button" />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

The example above achieves the same goals as the first example â€” apply the same
styles to multiple instances of `Button` in the app. However this example
applies the `raised` prop to every instance of `Button` inside the component
tree under `ThemeProvider`. Both of these buttons will have the `raised` prop
set to true.

This is extremely convenient and is made possible through
[React's Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

### Light and dark mode

React Native Elements also provides a preset dark mode palette to get you started with using dark mode in your app.
Use the prop `mode` in `createTheme` to set the default dark theme. You may want to set this by using a button,
or by using the user's configured settings

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider, Button, createTheme } from '@rneui/themed';

const myTheme = createTheme({
  lightColors: {
    primary: '#f2f2f2',
  },
  darkColors: {
    primary: '#121212',
  },
  mode: 'dark',
});

// Your App
const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={myTheme}>
      <Button title="My Button" />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

But how to switch modes?

```jsx
import { useTheme } from '@rneui/themed';

const App = () => {
  const { updateTheme } = useTheme();

  const switchToDarkMode = () => {
    updateTheme({
      mode: 'dark',
    });
  };

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    updateTheme((theme) => ({
      mode: theme.mode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light',
    }));
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Button title="Toggle Theme" onPress={toggleTheme} />
      <Button title="Dark" onPress={switchToDarkMode} />
    </>
  );
};

const theme = createTheme({
  Text: (prop) => ({
    style: prop.h5 && { fontSize: 8 },
  }),
});
const theme = createTheme({
  Text: {
    h5Style: { fontSize: 8 },
  },
});
```
