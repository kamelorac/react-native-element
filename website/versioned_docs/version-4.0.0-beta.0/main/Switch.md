import Usage from './usage/Switch/Switch.md'

Switch represents user's decision of a process and indicates whether a state is on/off.

Switch is a controlled component that requires an `onValueChange` to update the `value` prop.

This renders a `boolean` value. React native elements provide you with additional `theme` and `color` support in the Switch Button.

This component inherits [all native Switch props that come with a standard React Native Switch element](https://reactnative.dev/docs/switch.html).
