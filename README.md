## Quick Start

Start using the components or try it on
[Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@arpitbhalla/react-native-elements).

```tsx
import { Button } from '@rneui/base';

const App = () => <Button title="Hello World!" />;
```

## React Native Web support

As a cross platform UI Toolkit, you can now use RNE on the web & share your codebase between your React Native + React web apps. RNE components are rendered perfectly on browser. You can achieve this to target iOS, Android and Web by collaborating RNE and [React Native for Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).

Click [here](https://reactnativeelements.com/blog/2018/12/13/react-native-web) for a full walkthrough using React Native Elements + React Native Web.

## Expo demo app

Checkout the official
[React Native Elements App](https://expo.dev/@rneui/react-native-elements)
on Expo which uses all of the React Native Elements components.

If you are looking to contribute to the React Native Elements App,
