# React Native Elements App

**[Mobile App](https://expo.dev/@rneui/react-native-elements)**

This is the Demo app for [React Native Elements](https://expo.dev/@rneui/react-native-elements) built with [Expo](https://expo.io/). The purpose of this app is to demonstrate the usage of the various UI components that React Native Elements provides out of the box.

This app also works on the `web` platform using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). If you are looking to build a React Native mobile app which can reuse the code to deploy it on the web, this is the right place to begin. We decided to use [Expo](https://expo.io/), which reduces the effort required to build an app once and deploy it anywhere.

## Getting Started

### Run it locally

1. Install [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/)

   ```bash
   [sudo] npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

   _If permissions errors then please use `--unsafe-perm=true` flag too [npm/npm#16766](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/16766)_

2. Clone the project

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements.git
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   cd react-native-elements

   # Using yarn
   yarn install

   # Using npm
   npm install

   cd example
   ```

4. Run the cross-platform app (uses [Expo](https://expo.io/learn))

   ```bash
   # Using yarn
   yarn start

   # Using npm
   npm start
   ```

### Deploy Web App

First you must set correct `publicPath` in `app.web-build.json`. Next you must build the web app using:

```bash
yarn web
```

Once you have built it, you can see generated `web-build` folder.

This folder can be hosted as static website. For example, you can publish on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) via [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) cli.

```bash
yarn deploy
```

**Note:** Don't forget to add or change "homepage" key in your package.json!

### Ejecting

The mobile app is built using Expo. If you would like to eject, you can run the following command:

```bash
# Using Yarn
yarn eject

# Using npm
npm run eject
```

We highly recommend you read the [official Expo ejection docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/eject/) before proceeding, as the action of ejecting is not reversible.
